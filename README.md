# Social Media is Isolating, Let's Fix That

Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, how often do you really make a friend with a stranger on these apps? Messaging apps like Discord were among the first to really bring about deep personal connections and relationships to that expected level: the basic comforts we feel from meeting a new person online with something in common to bond over. What's missing is a social media app to glue them all together, to foster connections based on user activities & interests, and to route users to their own preferred apps to connect. The fatal flaw to a new social media app (among many) will be trying to compete in areas that these other giants do well already: no one wants to use a new app on their phone to get the same features as the others. 

Capybara enhances the user experience of every social media app you connect to it, it connects users with common history on youtube, spotify, twitch, and more activities online. This provides a direct line for users of Capybara to view your customizeable profile card which links out to your own favorite social media apps. Much like the real-life counterpart, Capybara is a universal friend to these social media applications you already use. The intention is to make social media less isolatory, to foster more personal connections on social media giants, and to enhance the experience for users of every one of those selected applications. (Twitter, Facebook, etc.)
