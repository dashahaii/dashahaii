### üßë‚Äçüíº Technical Experience

My first ever techincal position was for the IT department at the University of Akron (UA). The bar was low and telling them I helped my mom's greenhousing business with the website & emails (GoDaddy) actually impressed them, which in retrospect was perfet on my resume besides all of the retail/food service jobs I miserably held in my teenage years.

Working on the computer, doing knowledge work of some capacity, was all I ever wanted to do. I found myself in the Computer Science program learning to program C++, while the IT Department was sending me the way of hardware repair and technical support. It turned out talking people's ears off was more my thing than handling a screwdriver, while all the other repair students wanted to just fix computers all day. (Separation of labor etc.)

My evolution after that was rather quick, after spending a semester in hardware repair, a semester on helpdesk phones, I applied and was accepted for a Systems Administrator Intern position in UA's IT office. I'd say this job was way more complex than anything I had done previously, and it was very educational, but I was very much still just a sophomore in college. After the internship I returned for a few months to the help desk phones, then took on something a bit more closer to my degree: web design. In pure HTML & style attributes, along with bootstrap 4 (no separate stylesheets) for 2 semesters I worked as s web designer on the other side of campus for the College of Arts & Sciences. (We used a system called dotCMS.)

Too short after I started the web design position, which was a part-time role advertised for a creative CS student, I was accepted to intern at Hive Networks Inc., which while my campus jobs were excellent, my bosses were excited for me to get this internship and to dive much deeper into applications development professionally.

### üíº Software Engineering Intern

This past summer (2024) I completed an internship at a company called Hive Networks Inc. Before the interview, I studied immensely about the company and learned they were a business connecting doctors & researchers to help fight rarer diseases specifically. I was hired on based on my resume, interview, and passion for the company's product: a software platform in Vue & TypeScript (Koa.js) mostly to allow doctors in a Learning Health Network to collaborate easier, featuring typical products such as a document library, OpenOffice built-in, FormStack built-in, an Azure AI Search module integrated directly into the document library, chart-making, project planning, and much more. Hive Networks is a small company, so I was able to take upon myself a lot of complex & difficult bugs and user stories in a short amount of time in the Summer. The work was difficult for me, but it was all I had been looking forward to throughout the CS program, and it helped made me know I was meant to be in this field.

Now, as Hive Networks currently doesn't have any open positions for dev, (very small company at the moment) and I was hired on through the Department of Development program, it makes sense that a full-time position and internship cost very different things to a smaller organization.

In my last semester, Fall 2024, I am actively seeking full-stack Software Engineer roles to match my experience I had at Hive Networks. I felt passionate about the products we made, I learned a lot about Vue & TypeScript, and I met some great people. I am prepared to be a full-time developer for YOUR web apps, but in the meantime I will be applying to all adjacent positions both internship and full-time.
