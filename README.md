### üßë‚Äçüíº Technical Experience

While working on collaborative technical projects at the University of Akron, I have also been employed on-campus in various part-time roles as an IT analyst, systems administrator, and as a web designer for the Buchtel College of Arts & Sciences. This experience has made me what I am today as a developer. I graduate December 2024.

### üíº Software Engineering Intern

I have accepted an internship this summer with Hive Networks, a healthcare startup looking to increase patient outcomes through collaborative software for clinicians & researchers. I'm currently honing my skills in TypeScript, learning the Vue & Quasar frontend frameworks, and getting experience with a microservices backend spread out among various .NET & Koa.js APIs. This is my first job as a software engineer and I'm absolutely loving it, but that's also thanks to the great people I've been working with at Hive.
