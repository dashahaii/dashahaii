### üßë‚Äçüíº Technical Experience
While working on collaborative technical projects at the University of Akron, I have also been employed on-campus in various part-time roles as an IT analyst, systems administrator, and as a web designer for the Buchtel College of Arts & Sciences. This experience has made me what I am today as a developer. I graduate December 2024.

### üíº Software Engineering Intern
I have accepted an internship this summer with Hive Networks, a healthcare startup looking to increase patient outcomes through cutting-edge software. This will make me a better fullstack developer as my tasks will revolve around everything related, from frontend to backend to SQL to testing. This will make my second internship after completing one in the UA IT department as a Systems Administrator.

### üõ†Ô∏è Floorspaces: live data integrated with floor models of your business venue.
My class partner Nicholas Limbach and I our working on our capstone project, which I have come up with long-term plans to turn it into a business after college. It is software that allows businesses to draw live maps and have their own data & users interact with the rendered "floorspace." To make the core features of this application valuable, marketable, and fun - we look to continue development of the Floorspace Unity interfaces as standalone architectural design software first. This will have simplicity, ease-of-design, and simulation of people and objects as the priority of Floorspaces' Architect, which intends to cater to a different audience than high-detail software like Autodesk makes.
