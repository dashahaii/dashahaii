### üíº Software Engineering Intern

This past summer (2024) I completed an internship at a company called Hive Networks Inc. Before the interview, I studied immensely about the company and learned they were a business connecting doctors & researchers to help fight rarer diseases specifically. I was hired on based on my resume, interview, and passion for the company's product: a software platform in Vue & TypeScript (Koa.js) mostly to allow doctors in a Learning Health Network to collaborate easier, featuring typical products such as a document library, OpenOffice built-in, FormStack built-in, an Azure AI Search module integrated directly into the document library, chart-making, project planning, and much more. Hive Networks is a small company, so I was able to take upon myself a lot of complex & difficult bugs and user stories in a short amount of time in the Summer. The work was difficult for me, but it was all I had been looking forward to throughout the CS program, and it helped made me know I was meant to be in this field.

Now, as Hive Networks currently doesn't have any open positions for dev, (very small company at the moment) and I was hired on through the Department of Development program, it makes sense that a full-time position and internship cost very different things to a smaller organization.

In my last semester, Fall 2024, I am actively seeking full-stack Software Engineer roles to match my experience I had at Hive Networks. I felt passionate about the products we made, I learned a lot about Vue & TypeScript, and I met some great people. I am prepared to be a full-time developer for YOUR web apps, but in the meantime I will be applying to all adjacent positions both internship and full-time.
