## What I am working on

In private repositories I have been building software I've called Capybara. It is a social networking platform that matches users together in digital spaces based on their online watch activity. Capybara only connects people, it is not a communication or media app, it excels in matching people based on common interests such as watching the same YouTube creator, for instance. Profile cards host various links to other platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, or any way you'd like to communicate with new users. 

Capybara is named as it is because I see it as a universal friend instead of a competitor to social media platforms (or animals in this metaphor.) This may imply Capybara itself is a social media app, and maybe it is in some technical way, but I prefer to call it a "social networking" app. My chief aim is to give a tool to the world that connects people and starts organic connections where we find ourselves continually isolated with the social media landscape as it stands.

Capybara itself will have a 3D interactive space for each community, where profile cards may be customized and navigated through on a global map. (We do not take your location, you may place yourself anywhere.) Development consists of a web application frontend with React + Vite, a mobile app with React Native, a middleware with Koa.js, as well as Vercel & Supabase.

I strive to create a well-tested secure software system that is financially equitable to its users, keeps only the absolutely necessary data, and protects that data securely. I've been building out the start of Capybara for a short while now, but I am stopping to create a small prototype for my college class to showcase connecting users in networks via their YouTube API data.

Essentially for that small prototype, which I will call Capybara Social, the matching process will feed into a swipeable UI similar to dating apps. This will be a React Native app. I will also host code publically for a browser extension which will help grow Capybara network invites in time.
