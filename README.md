Repositories contain various projects I worked on throughout the University of Akron Computer Science Program. Grad. December 2024.

## What I am currently working on

In private repositories I have been building software I've called Capybara. It is a social networking platform that matches users together in digital spaces based on their online watch activity. Capybara only connects people, it is not a communication or media app, it excels in matching people based on common interests such as watching the same YouTube creator, for instance. Profile cards host various links to other platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, or any way you'd like to communicate with new users. 

#### Capybara consists of:

* React + Vite + Material UI + R3F frontend for users, globe presentation similar to a map.
* React Native Paper + Expo frontend for mobile devices.
* C#/.NET API to facilitate core logic and data processing.
* SQL instance to contain the data.

Capybara is named as it is because I see it as a universal friend instead of a competitor to social media platforms (or animals in this metaphor.) This may imply Capybara itself is a social media app, and maybe it is in some technical way, but I prefer to call it a "social networking" app. My chief aim is to give a tool to the world that connects people and starts organic connections where we find ourselves continually isolated with the social media landscape as it stands.
